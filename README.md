Uses Shopify's API to pull shipping info of all unfulfilled orders, using order numbers, onto a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

# Why was this created?
During my time as a delivery driver for a small business, I had to collect the shipping addresses of many customers, searching each customer one by one on my employer's Shopify website. This quickly became time-consuming, especially during heavy order weeks. In order to combat this inefficiency, I found a combination of Shopify's API and Google Apps Script to be the perfect solution, given that my employer used Google Sheets to mark down orders.
